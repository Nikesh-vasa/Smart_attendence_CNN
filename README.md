# 🎯 Face Recognition Attendance System

This project is a **Face Recognition-based Attendance System** that uses a webcam to capture real-time photos, detects faces using OpenCV, and identifies individuals using a CNN model built with TensorFlow. It logs attendance automatically by writing recognized names and timestamps to a CSV file.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The system works in 3 stages:

1. **Data Collection** (`capture.py`) – Collects face images from the webcam and saves them in a structured folder based on the user's roll number.
2. **Model Training** (`train_model.py`) – Preprocesses the collected images and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify faces.
3. **Real-time Attendance** (`interface.py`) – Uses the trained model to recognize faces from the webcam feed and logs attendance into a CSV file.
